                Kermit Frog and Piggy Lee were kidnapped. With the most unlikely kidnapper to be held accountable, 
                Not-So-Local News Today has all the details. Kermit&#39s kidnapper reportedly wouldn&#39t 
                stop talking about needing another 50&cent; before being able to get what it needed. 
                What monster needs money, one might ask? The answer is simple: The Loch Ness Monster.
                Kermit was able to draw this from memory in an interview just after his escape.<br>

                        <p>
                It would appear as though the Loch Ness Monster is once again on a monetary-themed rampage,
                combing through the world in search of just enough to procure what it REALLY wants. But,
                what on Earth DOES it really want? What would any monster want to buy for $3.50? <br>

                Kermit had this to say: <q>While finally making our escape from our captor, we saw
                it&#39s vending machine. I just don&#39t understand why something that big would want a salad. 
                And so badly that it would kidnap and steal for it! Diets are nice, but c&#39mon!
                It doesn&#39t even open those things, it just eats it whole! Glass and all! I guess
                this is just what we get for wanting a nice quiet walk by the lake.</q><br>

                Just days after gaining her freedom, Piggy <q>Miss Piggy</q> Lee has a new perspective on life:
                <q>You take things for granted, when you&#39re a star. But, when you&#39re SOMEONE&#39S star, it becomes
                abundantly clear that you probably won&#39t get to be who and what you want anymore. There&#39s no more
                holding back Missy Piggy! I almost lost my shot at being the biggest actress, singer, dancer, musician ...
                ahem... et cetera! No Loch Ness Monster is gonna be taking that away from ME! I am gonna have it all!</q> <br>

                <h3>Not letting it hold them back</h3>
                <p> Now that they&#39re out of the clutches of what may have been an evil monster or a deranged creature
                    needing help, these two are back in the limelight. It&#39s happiness abound for the moment, but just
                    how long will it last? Will Nessy find them again to collect what it feels it&#39s owed? After all,
                    Kermit tells us how important a diet can be to...will Nessy agree? 
                </p>
                <h3>Either way, these muppets are back to living the dream, though Kermit can be seen still wary</h3>
